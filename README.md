### Repo is still a WIP, so I'll update it as I go, just wanted to get the files out there, for those that have been waiting.


99.99% of the credit for this one goes to HartK & Yeri for their awesome machines, I've just brought them together as I love the aesthetics of Micron *(I'm not at all biased, honestly)*, but wanted to build a Salad Fork.


For now, I've uploaded all the required STLs for a 180mm Stealth Fork.

CAD coming soon, once I've finished cleaning it up!

There are some parts you will need to pull directly from the Micron R1 Repo, these are:

- [Panel Clips, handle, misc](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta/STLs/Panels) - All except: Bowden Entry Accent Front Cover, Top Hinge Leaf

- [X Axis](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta/STLs/Gantry/X_Axis) - All

- [AB Double Sheer Mounts](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta/STLs/Gantry/AB_Drives/double_shear_mounts) - All

- [Front Skirt Display Mounts](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta/STLs/Skirts/Displays) - All except: Bezels


### All STLs should be corectly orientated.

These are beta files, so there may be some slight tweaks required. Whilst I've printed everything of, I've not yet built the machine.
