## About  

Stealth Fork is an experimental design that blends the awesome aesthetic and compact form factor of the [**Micron+ R1**](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/R1_Beta) with the fixed gantry of the [**Salad Fork**.](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Salad_Fork) If you've ever wanted a machine that captures the best aspects of both, this is it.  

This repo is a **work in progress**, and I'll be updating it as things evolve. The goal is to make the build process as seamless as possible while maintaining the high-quality standards of both parent designs.  

## Current Status  

- âœ… **STLs Uploaded** â€“ All required STLs for a **180mm build** are included.  
- ðŸ”œ **CAD Files Coming Soon** â€“ Once the files are cleaned up, they'll be added to the repo.  
- âš  **Beta Release** â€“ While all parts have been printed successfully, a full machine assembly is still pending. Expect minor refinements.

## Required Parts from Micron R1  

Some parts are not included in this repo and need to be pulled directly from the **Micron R1 Repo** to convert your current Salad Fork.
